#### NIC
Network Interface Card, Network Interface Controller, Network Adaptor
#### NGFW
Next-generation firewall (Application control, User-ID, Parallel traffic inspection)
## P
#### Public key

#### Private key
My secret key that I can use to decrypt data that was sent to me encrypted with the public key I shared with the world
#### PaaS
Platform as a Service
## S
#### Split tunneling
Splitting of traffic between Remote gateway and Internet
#### Sniffer
Software or hardware solution to capture raw packets sent over wired or wireless networks
#### Sandboxing
Technology to safety inspect potentially malicious files
#### SaaS
Software as a Service
#### SYSLOG

#### SOAR
Security Orchestration, Automation and Response
#### SLA
Service level agreement
#### SIEM
Security information and event management
#### SCA
Software Composition Analisys
#### SBOM
Software bill of materials, includes analisys of all the software running in the system, fingerprinting the files and libraries. Some of the SBOMs can include data about hardware, vulnerabilities, credentials, certificates, keys etc.
#### SASE
N/A
## U
#### User-id
User identification
#### URL Filtering
Security control to block malicious URLs or URL blocked by the company’s Policy
#### UBA

Term that used to describe a tunnel that connects peers using IPSEC technology
#### VPN
Virtual Private Network
#### VMS
N/A
#### VA
Vulnerability assesment, done on the software source code or a binary to determine vulnerabilites that can be affecting the software components, application or a whole firmware in case of embedded devices.
## X
#### x.509
In cryptography, X.509 is a standard defining the format of public key certificates. X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for HTTPS, the secure protocol for browsing the web. They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures. RFC [2459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2459) [4158](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4158) [5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280)
## Z 
#### ZTNA 
Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions, also referred to as a software-defined perimeter or SDP, are used to provide secure access to private applications without allowing users access to enterprise networks. They are often described as a replacement for traditional technologies like VPN, and introduce various methods of authentication to remain identity and context aware of users accessing enterprise applications. ZTNA solutions are available self-hosted, from the cloud and self-managed, or as fully managed services.
